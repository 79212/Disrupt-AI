# How do I prepare for the hackathon?

It&#39;s all about project ideas and hackathon resources! Below are some suggestions to get you started with both.

## Ideas

Disrupt AI is all about finding ways to use innovation to disrupt YOUR industry. Different teams will find inspiration from different challenges they face at work. Here&#39;s a few ideas to get you started:

### Financial Services­­­­

- Can you use machine learning to better understand your customer? Detect and analyze buying patterns, financial behaviors, customer satisfaction, fraud detection in transactions, and risk profiles.
- Can you use bots, sentiment analysis, or natural language processing to improve call center operations?

### Retail

- Can you use machine learning to better understand your customer? Detect and analyze buying patterns, or segment customers for loyalty programs and promotions
- Can you leverage bots, natural language processing, and intelligent search to create an omni-channel experience to better engage your customers online and offline?
- Can you leverage the Internet of Things and data insights to make day to day operations more effective?

### Healthcare

- Can you use machine learning and online services to improve the effectiveness of clinical care? Use predictive learning to provide care guidance, effective treatment planning, population health management, analysis of medical imaging, and pre/post surgery support
- Can you Leverage AI and machine learning to improve operations? Use predictive learning to improve staffing, admission management, wait times, and bed allocation

### Manufacturing

- Can you automate tasks to allow your workforce to focus on higher-value activities?
- Can you build smarter systems? Leverage IoT, improved sensors and the rollout of 5G connectivity to collect data, gain insights to increase responsiveness and improve efficiency.
